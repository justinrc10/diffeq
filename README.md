Differential equation approximator

Given a differential equation, it can be very difficult or even impossible to solve analytically.
Because of this, numerical methods are often employed to approximate solutions.

This program generates a list of approximated sample points and outputs a graph of a given function.
To input the function, one must modify the function f in the code.

Currently, the code uses Euler's method (blue graph) and the Runge-Kutta method (red graph).
I plan on adding in one more method, as the accuracy can vary significantly for certain equations.
